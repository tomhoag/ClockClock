# ClockClock

Silly little iOS app that builds a digitial clock out of analog clock faces.

For fun, press and hold to see the clocks animate digits sequentially from the current time:

Swipe left for settings (change foreground and background color, hand width)

oops -- this screenshot caught the hands in transition . . .
